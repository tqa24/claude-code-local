**Everything works — text, images, and video:**

| Command | What happens | You get |
|---|---|---|
| "summarize this article" | Qwen reads + replies | 💬 Text |
| "send me a screenshot of X" | Claude screenshots | 📸 Image in iMessage |
| "screen record you doing Y" | Records + sends | 🎥 Video in iMessage |
| "make me a produced video" | Full edit pipeline | 🎬 Title card + subs |

**Full pipeline repo:** [nicedreamzapp/claude-screen-to-phone](https://github.com/nicedreamzapp/claude-screen-to-phone)
→ Clone it, run `setup.sh`, fill in your phone number. Works with this local AI stack or Claude cloud.

We built this **before** Anthropic shipped their Dispatch feature. Same concept, but ours uses iMessage, runs on your local model, and can send back media — not just text.

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Anthropic's Dispatch doesn't read your CLAUDE.md. Mention it in your message or it'll miss your custom setup. Our iMessage system doesn't have this problem.

## 🔧 Tool-Call Reliability (v2 — March 2026)

Local models don't format tool calls perfectly. Qwen 3.5 122B frequently garbles the format — it *wants* to call a tool but mixes XML and JSON syntax. Claude Code sees no valid tool call, re-prompts, and the model does it again. The result: **infinite loops where the AI says "let me do that" but never actually does anything.**

We fixed this. Here's what was happening and what we did about it.

### 🐛 The Problem

The model was generating garbled tool calls like this:
```
<tool_call>
<function=Bash><parameter=command>rm -rf /tmp/old</parameter></function>
</tool_call>
```

Instead of the correct JSON format Claude Code expects:
```json
<tool_call>
{"name": "Bash", "arguments": {"command": "rm -rf /tmp/old"}}
</tool_call>
```

The JSON parser choked, Claude Code saw no tool call, re-prompted the model, and the model garbled it the exact same way again — creating an infinite loop.

### ✅ The Fix (4 changes to `server.py`)

| Change | What | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| **KV Cache** | 4-bit → 8-bit, quantization starts at token 1024 | Model retains conversation context instead of "forgetting" earlier messages |
| **Temperature** | 0.7 → 0.2 | Less randomness = more consistent tool formatting |
| **Garbled Recovery** | New `recover_garbled_tool_json()` function | Catches XML-in-JSON hybrids, `<function=X><parameter=Y>` inside `<tool_call>` tags, and infers tool names from parameter keys |
| **Retry Logic** | Up to 2 retries when tool intent is detected but parsing fails | Re-prompts with explicit formatting instructions before giving up |

### 🧪 Test Results

We built an automated test suite (`scripts/test_mlx_server.py`) that sends real Anthropic API requests to the server simulating multi-step tasks — the exact kind that were failing before.

```
Test Suite: 14 tests per run
─────────────────────────────
  ✅ Simple Bash commands
  ✅ Directory creation (mkdir -p)
  ✅ File reading (Read tool)
  ✅ Complex Bash with pipes
  ✅ File editing (Edit tool with find/replace)
  ✅ Multi-tool sequences (Glob → Read)
  ✅ 5 rapid-fire sequential commands
  ✅ Multi-step calendar scenario (create → delete → verify)
```

**Results: 98/98 tests passed across 7 consecutive runs. Zero failures.**

The multi-step calendar scenario — create 12 month folders, delete all but September, verify — was the exact task that triggered infinite loops before the fix. Now it passes every time.

```bash
# Run the test suite yourself:
python3 scripts/test_mlx_server.py
```

### ⚙️ Tuning

You can override defaults with environment variables:

| Variable | Default | What It Does |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MLX_KV_BITS` | `8` | KV cache quantization bits (4 saves memory, 8 improves coherence) |
| `MLX_KV_QUANT_START` | `1024` | Token position where KV quantization begins (higher = better recent memory) |
| `MLX_TOOL_RETRIES` | `2` | Max retries when a garbled tool call is detected |
| `MLX_MAX_TOKENS` | `8192` | Max output tokens per response |

## 💡 How We Got Here

Most people trying to run Claude Code locally hit the same wall:

> Claude Code speaks **Anthropic API**. Local models speak **OpenAI API**. Different languages. 🤷

So everyone builds a **proxy** to translate between them. That proxy adds latency, complexity, and breaks things.

**We took a different approach:**

| 🐌 What everyone else does | 🚀 What we did |
|---|---|
| Claude Code → **Proxy** → Ollama → Model | Claude Code → **Our Server** → Model |
| 3 processes, 2 API translations | **1 process, 0 translations** |
| 133 seconds per task | **17.6 seconds per task** |

> 🎯 That one change — **eliminating the proxy** — made it **7.5x faster**.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (4 Steps)

### 1️⃣ Set up Python environment

```bash
python3.12 -m venv ~/.local/mlx-server
~/.local/mlx-server/bin/pip install mlx-lm
```

### 2️⃣ Download the AI model

First run downloads ~50 GB (one time only):

```bash
~/.local/mlx-server/bin/python3 -c "
from mlx_lm.utils import load
load('mlx-community/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-4bit')
print('Done!')
"
```

### 3️⃣ Start the server

```bash
~/.local/mlx-server/bin/python3 proxy/server.py
```

### 4️⃣ Launch Claude Code

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000 \
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-local \
claude --model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

> 💡 **Or just double-click** `Claude Local.command` on your Desktop. It does all of this automatically.

## 🎯 Orchestrator API (NEW)

A REST API that lets any client — web app, mobile app, another AI, or a simple `curl` command — control your entire Mac through local AI. Browser, apps, screen recording, all from one endpoint.

```
Any client (web app, mobile, curl)
     │
     ▼
🎯 Orchestrator API (port 4001)
     ├── ⚡ MLX Server (port 4000) ← local AI brain
     ├── 🌐 Brave CDP (port 9222) ← browser control
     ├── 📹 Studio Record.app      ← screen recording
     └── 🖥️ macOS (AppleScript)    ← app control
```

### Start the API

```bash
# Double-click the launcher:
open "Orchestrator API.command"

# Or start manually:
~/.local/mlx-server/bin/python3 proxy/api.py
```

### Submit a task (natural language)

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:4001/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Start recording for 4 minutes, open Yahoo News, find a food article, and draft a comment"}'

# Returns: {"id": "abc123", "status": "pending"}
```

### Check progress

```bash
curl localhost:4001/tasks/abc123
# Returns: status, steps taken, results
```

### Real-time progress via WebSocket

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:4001/ws/tasks/abc123");
ws.onmessage = (e) => console.log(JSON.parse(e.data));
// Streams: {"type": "step", "step": {"tool": "browser_navigate", ...}}
```

### Direct tool access

```

The server (`proxy/server.py`) is **one file, ~600 lines**. It does four things:

1. 📦 **Loads the model** — Apple's MLX framework, native Metal GPU, unified memory
2. 🔌 **Speaks Anthropic API** — Claude Code thinks it's talking to Anthropic's cloud. It's not.
3. 🔧 **Translates tool use** — Converts Anthropic tool definitions ↔ Qwen's native format, parses `<tool_call>` tags back into Anthropic `tool_use` blocks
4. 🧹 **Cleans the output** — Qwen thinks out loud in `<think>` tags. We strip those.

---

## 🌐 Browser Agent

A standalone browser agent (`agent.py`) that controls your **real Brave browser** via Chrome DevTools Protocol — powered entirely by local AI. No Claude Code wrapper needed.

```
         📝 Your task
          │
     🤖 agent.py              ← autonomous browser agent
          │
     ⚡ MLX Server (Qwen 122B) ← local AI decides what to do
          │
     🌐 Brave (CDP port 9222) ← clicks, types, navigates your real browser
          │
     📊 Context Meter          ← shows memory usage so you know its limits
```

**Context memory pipeline** — the agent doesn't forget what it's doing:

| | 🐌 Old Behavior | 🚀 New Pipeline |
|---|---|---|
| **Memory** | Hard drop after 5 steps | Smart trim at 60% of 32K budget |
| **When trimming** | Deletes old steps entirely | Compresses into summary |
| **Original task** | Lost after step 6+ | Re-injected every cycle |
| **Visibility** | None — flying blind | Color-coded context meter |
| **Response tokens** | 1,024 | 2,048 |

The context meter shows green/yellow/red after each step:
```
  Step 5 snapshot() 2.2s
         → [101] heading "The Best Coffee Cake Recipe"...
  [Context: 18% ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 6K/32K tokens]    ← green = plenty of room
```

> 💡 **Double-click** `Browser Agent.command` to launch. It starts the MLX server, opens Brave with remote debugging, and drops you into the agent.

## 🔒 Security

We audited every component before running it:

| Component | Source | Network Calls | Verdict |
|-----------|--------|:---:|:---:|
| **server.py** | We wrote it | 0 | ✅ Safe |
| **MLX framework** | Apple | 0 | ✅ Safe |
| **Qwen 3.5 model** | HuggingFace verified | 0 | ✅ Safe |

🚫 No telemetry
🚫 No analytics
🚫 No phone-home
🚫 No sketchy pip packages

> ⚠️ We [removed LiteLLM](https://x.com/Tahseen_Rahman/status/2035501506242240520) after supply chain attack concerns were raised. Every dependency was audited.

## 🛤️ The Journey

We didn't start here. We went through three generations in one night:

| Gen | What We Tried | Speed | 💡 What We Learned |
|:---:|---|:---:|---|
| 1️⃣ | Ollama + custom proxy | 30 tok/s | Ollama works but Claude Code can't talk to it directly |
| 2️⃣ | llama.cpp TurboQuant + proxy | 41 tok/s | TurboQuant compresses KV cache 4.9x, but the proxy is the bottleneck |
| 3️⃣ | **MLX native server** | **65 tok/s** | **Kill the proxy. Speak Anthropic API directly. 7.5x faster.** |

> 🎯 Each generation taught us something. The final insight — the proxy was the bottleneck, not the model — changed everything.
