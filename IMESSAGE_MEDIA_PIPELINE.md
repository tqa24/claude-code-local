# 📱 iMessage Media Pipeline — Fully Working

> **All of this works with both Claude Code (cloud) and your local Qwen 3.5 122B model.**
> The scripts are pure shell/AppleScript — the AI just calls them. Model doesn't matter.

## 🔑 The Key Discovery — Video Sending

AppleScript `send file to buddy` is broken/restricted on macOS Sonoma+.
Text sends fine. File attachments fail silently with the obvious approach.

**What doesn't work:**
```bash
# ❌ returns success but "not delivered" on phone
osascript -e 'tell app "Messages" to send POSIX file "/path/to/video.mp4" to buddy "..."'
```

**What works:**
```
1. Finder selects the file → Cmd+C (copies as proper file object)
2. open imessage://+1XXXXXXXXXX (opens/focuses conversation)
3. Cmd+V paste into Messages input
4. Return to send
```

This works because Finder's clipboard type is recognized by Messages — direct AppleScript file sends are not.

## 📁 The Tools (install via setup.sh)

All scripts live in `~/.claude/` after running `setup.sh`:

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `~/.claude/imessage-send.sh "text"` | Send a text message |
| `~/.claude/imessage-send-image.sh /path` | Send an image |
| `~/.claude/imessage-send-video.sh /path` | Send a video (auto-compresses >95MB) |
| `~/.claude/imessage-toggle.sh` | Toggle mobile mode flag on/off |
| `~/.claude/imessage-receive.sh` | Wait up to 5 min for a reply |

**Studio Record** (screen recording app):
```bash
python studio-record/studio_record.py &   # launch
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:17494/start?mode=screen  # start recording
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:17494/stop               # stop + save
```

## 🔗 Full Repo

All scripts and Studio Record are in a separate standalone repo:
**[nicedreamzapp/claude-screen-to-phone](https://github.com/nicedreamzapp/claude-screen-to-phone)**

That repo is self-contained — Mac + iPhone users can clone it, run `setup.sh`, and have the full pipeline without needing the local AI stack.

**This repo** (`claude-code-local`) wires it into your local AI so Qwen 3.5 122B is doing the thinking instead of Claude cloud.
